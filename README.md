This is a collection of exercises comparing R and Python by demonstrating how each accomplishes the same task. Despite the name, this isn't a competition; they're just tools.

Instead, the goal is to provide a basic resource that walks through some fundamentals in each language (and admittedly as an opportunity for me to "relearn" Python and learn more about R).

Exercises
=========

1. Output
---------

-   Program to show output
    -   [p1\_output.py](Python/p1_output.py)
    -   [p1\_output.R](R/p1_output.R)

2. Print "CS"
-------------

-   Write a program that prints out "CS!" in large block letters inside a border of `***`
    -   [p2\_print\_CS.py](Python/p2_print_CS.py)
    -   [p2\_print\_CS.R](R/p2_print_CS.R)

3. Input
--------

-   Take some user input and perform some operations before providing output
    -   [p3\_input.py](Python/p3_input.py)
    -   [p3\_input.R](R/p3_input.R)
