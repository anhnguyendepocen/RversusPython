# RversusPython

This is a collection of exercises comparing R and Python by demonstrating how each accomplishes the same task. Despite the name, this isn't a competition; they're just tools.

Instead, the goal is to provide a basic resource that walks through some fundamentals in each language (and admittedly as an opportunity for me to "relearn" Python and learn more about R).

1. Output: Program to show output
    * [p1_output.py](Python/p1_output.py)
    * [p1_output.R](R/p1_output.R)
2. Print "CS": Write a program that prints out "CS!" in large block letters inside a border of `***`
    * [p2_print_CS.py](Python/p2_print_CS.py)
    * [p2_print_CS.R](R/p2_print_CS.R)
