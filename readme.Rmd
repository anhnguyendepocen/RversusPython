```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,

This is a collection of exercises comparing R and Python by demonstrating how each accomplishes the same task. Despite the name, this isn't a competition; they're just tools.

Instead, the goal is to provide a basic resource that walks through some fundamentals in each language (and admittedly as an opportunity for me to "relearn" Python and learn more about R).

# Exercises

## 1. Output

* Program to show output
    + [p1_output.py](Python/p1_output.py)
    + [p1_output.R](R/p1_output.R)

## 2. Print "CS"

* Write a program that prints out "CS!" in large block letters inside a border of `***`
    + [p2_print_CS.py](Python/p2_print_CS.py)
    + [p2_print_CS.R](R/p2_print_CS.R)

## 3. Input

* Take some user input and perform some operations before providing output
    + [p3_input.py](Python/p3_input.py)
    + [p3_input.R](R/p3_input.R)

## 4. Print "C" with Input

* Write a program that prints out "CS!" in large block letters inside a border of `***`, using user input for letter selection.
    + [p4_print_C_any_letter.py](Python/p4_print_C_any_letter.py)
    + [p4_print_C_any_letter.R](R/p4_print_C_any_letter.R)
